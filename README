PHP/MySQL Dive log By Jonathan Ely

I developed this webfront end to display dive log data uploaded using the 
Diving Log 5.0 SQL dump feature. It makes use of jquery and the jqplot
plugin.

You can see it in action at jonathanely.com/divelog.

To get it running on your own website:
	1. Export and upload your MySQL divelog data from Diving Log 5.0
	2. Download the files from Github
	3. Modify mysql.php for your server
	4. Upload and enjoy
